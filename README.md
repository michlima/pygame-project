## Game Goal and Controls

### How to win & how to lose

After achieving a decided amount of points each player will race to achieve those points as fast as possible. First one there wins!

### How to play
#### Goal of the game
The goal of the game is to pick up boxes and place them on the same color dropoff zone in order to accumulate points. First player to get to 30 points will win. Box points are random and there is no way to know how much points a box has until you place it in it's corresponding drop-off zone.

#### Challenges
Boxes may contain a bomb but it is also impossible to know if a box contains a bomb until you pick it up. Once player has picked up the box and the box is a bomb it will turn into a bomb and player needs to discard the bomb in the black drop off zone before bomb explodes. If bomb explodes before player can discard the bomb then the player will lose points and will be unable to move for two seconds. If player can discard the bomb before it explodes he will receive the points atributed to it
